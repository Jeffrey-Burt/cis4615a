# COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS (MUST READ)
**In order to compile the code correctly**, the following must be done (I explained in the
  email what the issue was with this).
  To compile, the command line instruction will be as follows:
  `javac --release 8 <java file here>`
  This was due to differing versions with a JRE that was not able to handle JDK 13.0. I could not
  fix it on my side, so I had to do this workaround. This should produce the same results for you.
  To then run the Java program, the command line instruction will be as follows:
  `java <java file here>`
  , where <java file here> is the name of the Java file **WITHOUT** the .java suffix.
  Please let me know if you encounter any other issues.
